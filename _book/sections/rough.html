<h2 data-number="3.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="designing-machine-learning-systems"><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Designing Machine Learning Systems</h2>
<p>This book is about ML systems holistically, from model development through to model monitoring and retraining schedules</p>
<p>Most relevant chapters are Ch 1, 2, 7, 8, 10, maybe 11</p>
<p>From my perspective a lot of the narrative in this book assumes folks are using deep learning models, but most models in production are not deep learning</p>
<p>One paragraph at the beginning of Ch 7 seems to indicate that wrapping a model in an API such as FastAPI is easy (“all you have to do is…”) but then goes on to say that “deploying is easy if you ignore all the hard parts”</p>
<p>Several chapters highlight the need for managing multiple models, which can motivate some work on our part on model registry tooling I thought it was interesting how this book categorizes tools as orchestrators, schedulers, MLOps platforms, among others.</p>
<p>IMO our tools like vetiver don’t neatly fall into any of the tool categories outlined in this book; they work with an orchestrator or you could use them as part of your MLOps platform. Is that a problem? How do we best explain what these tools do?</p>
<p>There is a lot of discussion around using REST APIs. The main concern is the complexity with many APIs making many requests to each other, so brokers such as Kafka are held to the highest standard. (The trade off here of complexity is not worth it at this point?) (Actually, GitHub is moving more to REST, albeit away from GraphQL.)</p>
<p>There’s a different discussion about “reasonable scale” in Chapter 10, that is, companies that work with gigabytes or maybe terabytes of data a day. I think vetiver is an option for “reasonable scale” companies/models, where a REST API still makes the most sense. I spent a while wrestling with the online (predictions generated and returned as soon as requests arrive) vs.&nbsp;batch (predictions generated periodically).</p>
<p>I am debating changing my own language to synchronous vs.&nbsp;asynchronous. How to use the best language for clarity? “Batch prediction is a workaround for when online prediction isn’t cheap enough or fast enough.”</p>
<p>Noting another best practice: Having two different pipelines for training and inference is a common source for bugs for ML in production.</p>
<p>Monitoring toolbox: logs, dashboards, alerts. Depending on how DIY a developer is feeling, we have about 0.5/3 of these things. (What do we feel is our monitoring toolbox? How much is infrastructure dependent?) Michael</p>

<h2 data-number="3.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="machine-learning-operations-mlops-overview-definition-and-architecture"><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> Machine Learning Operations (MLOps): Overview, Definition, and Architecture</h2>
<p>This paper did a literature review, tool review, and a small set of expert interviews to create a definition of what MLOps is and includes. This paper views MLOps as DevOps principles/tooling applied to automating ML.</p>
<p>The result was a set of: Principles, like “workflow orchestration coordinates the tasks of ML via DAGs” and “Feedback loops are required to for quality assessment” Technical components, like “model registry” and “monitoring component” Roles, like “data scientist” and “DevOps engineer” Architecture, which is visualized in one of the most confusing (and worst IMO) diagrams I have ever seen 🤨</p>
<p>Big takeaway is that MLOps addresses the problem of data scientists managing ML workflows too manually</p>
<p>They create a paragraph-long definition, with this summary: “Essentially, MLOps aims to facilitate the creation of machine learning products by leveraging these principles: CI/CD automation, workflow orchestration, reproducibility; versioning of data, model, and code; collaboration; continuous ML training and evaluation; ML metadata tracking and logging; continuous monitoring; and feedback loops.”</p>

<h2 data-number="3.3" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mlops-principles"><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> MLOps Principles</h2>
<p>From INNOQ (consulting) See adoption as 3 levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>manual</p></li>
<li><p>ml pipeline</p></li>
<li><p>ci/cd</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Continuous X MLOps is an ML engineering culture that includes the following practices: Ci/CD but also ct(raining)/cm(monitoring)</p>
<p>Talked a lot about the point system paper I had also seen ML scorecard</p>
<p>Lots of discussion around what reproducibility looks like: data versioning, version control, deploying feature engineering with model. They specifically mention that the same programming language should be used for training and deployment.</p>
<p>There is the idea of “loosely coupled architecture” which means that teams can test and deploy applications without requiring orchestration with other services. They suggest using cookiecutter templates to help with this, which doesn’t seem to fit the full criteria of what is described as loosely coupled architecture???</p>

<h2 data-number="3.4" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="googles-practitioners-guide-to-mlops"><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Google’s Practitioners Guide to MLOps</h2>
<p>This white paper starts out with an overview of GCP’s perspective on the MLOps lifecycle and finishes with a focus on processes and capabilities.</p>
<p>This paper understands the MLOps cycle as seven stages, which are not totally sequential but somewhat iterative and integrated:</p>
<p><img src="../images/wkflw.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
<p>For this paper, it might not really be MLOps unless you are doing continuous retraining, although they do say things like, “If the ML system requires continuous training…”</p>
<p>This white paper outlines a set of core technical capabilities like ML pipelines, model training, etc.</p>
<p>There are three of these technical capabilities that our MLOps OSS tools aim to meet:</p>
<p>Model serving: Outlines different ways to serve models for prediction (including making online, offline/batch, streaming, and embedded predictions) and then talks about more advanced techniques like composite prediction routines (invoking models hierarchically).</p>
<p>Model monitoring: Encompasses both ops monitoring (like latency) and ML monitoring (like accuracy).</p>
<p>Model registry: Outlines the basics and extends to governing model launching from the registry.</p>
