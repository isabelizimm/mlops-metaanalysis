We feel model registries may become important, but they are not currently in our short-term plan. Currently, to make a model registry for R objects, you could use a mix of pins and htmlwidgets and this may become easy to implement in Python with Quarto."

Are these things that are out of scope, or that need more investment?\n\nWe hope to invest more time in monitoring, but need to balance the fact that a lot of the CI/CD in monitoring is infrastructure dependent.\nThe language of MLOps is still developing. Many terms such as “batch processing” have multiple conflicting meanings. We proposed to create a glossary of how we use terms in vetiver’s documentation. (or put this in current standing?)\nWe also feel it is important to inspect the incorporation of vetiver components with other MLOps projects, such as MLFlow or Metaflow.\nWe would like to use the “The ML Test Score: A Rubric for ML Production Readiness and Technical Debt Reduction” as a framework for to best understand where vetiver “wins points” to help explain to usefulness of the project in terms of best practices."
