kubernetes operator is meant to address a fundamental requirement of any data science / machine learning project running their pipelines on Kubernetes - which is to quickly provision a declarative

Basically, implementing the concept of No Ops. The fundamental principle is to utilise best of docker, kubernetes and programming language features to run a workflow with minimal workflow definition syntax. It is a Go based workflow running on command line or Kubernetes with the help of a custom operator for a quick and automated data pipeline for your machine learning projects (a flavor of
